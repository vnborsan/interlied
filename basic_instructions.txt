Hi There!

InterLied is a set of python GUI (interface) and python notebook, both designed for computational
music analysis. Although it is adapted for analysing vocal pieces only, lieder in particular, a majority of
its tools can be useful for other purposes as well. The notebook is appropriate for both,
computationally advanced and beginner users. If you assume, you belong to the latter, please go
through these instructions first and then open the GUI. The notebook does not require any coding
experience; however, you are strongly encouraged to not only utilise the GUI, but also the InterLied
notebook. All parameters are described in the notebook itself, thus, in order to get to it, scroll
through the following chapters and first install Python3, install all the (missing) prerequisite
dependencies and MuseScore or any other software for symbolic notation.

------

To use GUI, first install all prerequired dependencies. You can do that automatically by opening terminal (Linux / Mac OS) or prompt command (Windows) and type in:
 "cd your/path/to/interface/Interlied_1.0"

When you successfully enter the folder, type this command into terminal: 
"python interlied_dependencies.py"

If you run into some errors, install the required packages manually by following instructions in the INTERLIED_USER_MANUAL.

------

The Interlied offers 3 different types of codes.

1. ANALYSIS processes your scores and prepares dataframes (in csv form) for further data exploring.
2. VISUALISATIONS allow for your data to be refined and represented visually by graphs, as music notation and / or midi.
3. EXPLORATION section offers an easy access to refined data by your desired keywords.
